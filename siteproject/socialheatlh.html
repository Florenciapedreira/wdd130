                <p><p>What factors influence our social health?
                    <p>Factors such as employment conditions, social exclusion, public health programs, gender equity, early childhood development, globalization, health systems, evaluation of health variables, and healthy urbanization.</p></p>
                <p><p>How to improve social health from the individual?</p>
                <p>Dedicate time to our family and friends.</p>
                  To have healthy personal relationships, the most important thing is to give of ourselves. That means taking time to be with those we want to relate to.</p>
                <p>Choose wisely to whom we dedicate our time.
                  We already know that time is scarce and very valuable, hence when we decide to share it with other people, they must contribute to our well-being.</p>
                <p>Be open to experience and diversity.
                  To feel part of what surrounds us, it is important to be open to new experiences and other people.</p>
                <p>Take advantage of opportunities to contribute in our community.
                  If we want to have better social health, then we can start by helping to make our environment a healthier place.</p></p>
