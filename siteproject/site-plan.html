      <h3>Health</h3>
      <p>
        Starting at the foundation
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the World Health Organization, health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.
        On this site you will find exclusive information and activities that will help you develop new healthy lifestyle habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, we as humans are biopsychosocial beings, so our total health will depend on these three factors: physical health, emotional health, and social health. On this site you will find information and activities for all of them, since it is essential to find a healthy balance and well-being between these three important aspects.
      </p>
      <p> 
      We invite you to visit the different sections of Physical Health, Emotional Health and Social Health to discover new healthy habits, information, routines, recipes, exercises and tips that will help you feel better about yourself! Ahead!

      </ul>
      <h3>Emotional Health</h3>
      <p>Emotional health is the ability to be able to enjoy life and at the same time face the daily problems that arise, whether it is making decisions, dealing with and adapting to difficult situations or talking about our needs and desires.</p>
      <p>There are many ways to improve or maintain good emotional health.</p>
      <p>Be aware of your emotions and reactions. Notice what makes you sad, frustrated, or angry. </p>
      <p>Express your feelings appropriately. Let those close to you know when something is bothering you. </p>
      <p>Keeping feelings of sadness or anger hidden increases stress. This can cause problems in your relationships and at work or school.</p>
      <p>Think before you act. Give yourself time to think and be quiet before you say or do something you might regret.</p>
      <p>Manage stress. Learn relaxation methods to deal with stress. These could include deep breathing, meditation, and exercise.</p>
      <p>Aim for balance. Find a healthy balance between work and play, and between activity and rest. Take time to do the things you enjoy. Focus on the positive things in your life.</p>
      <p>Take care of your physical health. Exercise regularly, eat healthy meals, and get enough sleep. Do not abuse drugs or alcohol. Don't let physical health affect your emotional health.</p>
      <p>Connect with others. Make a lunch date, join a group and say hello to strangers. We need positive connections with other people.</p>
      <p>Find purpose and meaning. Find out what is important to you in life and focus on that. It could be work, your family, volunteering, caregiving, or something else. Take time to do what feels meaningful to you.</p>
      <p>Stay positive. Focus on the good things in life. Forgive yourself for making mistakes and forgive others. Spend time with healthy and positive people.</p>

      <h3>Social Health</h3>
      <p>Social health is the ability to adapt and self-manage in the face of changes and challenges in the environment, as well as the ability to develop satisfactory relationships with other people.</p>
      <p>What factors influence our social health?
      <p>Factors such as employment conditions, social exclusion, public health programs, gender equity, early childhood development, globalization, health systems, evaluation of health variables, and healthy urbanization.</p>
      <p>How to improve social health from the individual?</p>
      <p>Dedicate time to our family and friends.</p>
        To have healthy personal relationships, the most important thing is to give of ourselves. That means taking time to be with those we want to relate to.</p>
      <p>Choose wisely to whom we dedicate our time.
        We already know that time is scarce and very valuable, hence when we decide to share it with other people, they must contribute to our well-being.</p>
      <p>Be open to experience and diversity.
        To feel part of what surrounds us, it is important to be open to new experiences and other people.</p>
      <p>Take advantage of opportunities to contribute in our community.
        If we want to have better social health, then we can start by helping to make our environment a healthier place.</p>
