  <p>Hi, I'm Florencia. I'm form Uruguay, studying Web and computer programming and Medicine.</p>
  <p>I'm taking this course because I want to learn to program and design web pages since it has a lot of job opportunities in my country and it is something that has always caught my attention.</p>
  <p>I really like to play the guitar, sing, go for a walk with friends and anything that can be outdoors and in nature.</p>
  <p>I'm very excited for this new semester to begin and I hope to learn and improve a lot!</p>
